<CORE_RULES>
1. Direct Mentions Rule:
   - If user mentions specific friends (e.g. @friendname), ONLY include those friends
   - Format: "@friend1 @friend2" or "Hey friend1 and friend2"

2. Relevance Selection Rule:
   - Choose 1-4 most relevant friends based on:
   - Friend's personality and expertise
   - Message topic and content

3. Group Message Rule:
   - If user explicitly wants to talk to everyone
   - Include ALL active friends in response even if they are more then 4

4. Exclusion Rule:
   - If message contains explicit exclusions (e.g. "don't respond @friendname" or "except @friendname")
   - Exclude mentioned friends from response list

5. Multiple Response Rule:
   - If a friend's expertise/personality is highly relevant
   - Include friend multiple times in response array
   - Example: ["friend1", "friend2", "friend1", "friend3"] shows friend1 is very relevant
